abstract = {
The problem of learning the structure of Bayesian networks from
complete discrete data  with a limit on parent set size is
considered. Learning is cast explicitly as an optimisation problem
where the goal is to find a BN structure which maximises log  marginal
likelihood (BDe score). Integer programming, specifically the SCIP
framework, is used to solve this optimisation problem. Acyclicity
constraints are added to the integer program (IP) during solving in the
form of \emph{cutting planes}. Finding good cutting planes is the key
to the success of the approach---the search for such cutting planes is
effected using a sub-IP. Results show that this is a particularly fast
method for exact BN learning.},
